Very simple skeleton version of a google chrome screen scraper. 

The file is designed to scrape whatever website you are looking at for the specified data and outputs it into a file.

One use case of this design could be to scrape the data out of an webpage into a txt file. 

Now file just outputs it to a text file and displays it to the user along with an example of a popup pane.  

If you want this on a specific webpage only utilize the  "matches": ["http://*"], in the manifest.json on the content script.

Purpose of this file is so I can teach people how to design simple screen scraping chrome extension

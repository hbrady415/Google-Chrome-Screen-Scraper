Very simple skeleton version of a google chrome screen scraper I made for my company. 

The file is designed to scrape whatever website you are looking at for the specified data and outputs it into a file.

The original purpose was to output to a file which would be transfered into the database and analyzed and operated on from there so right now 

this file just outputs it to a text file and displays it to the user.  

Real purpose of this file is so I can teach people how to design simple screen scraping chrome extensionsusing unattached php files

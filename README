Very simple skeleton version of a google chrome screen scraper I made for my company. 

The file is designed to scrape whatever website you are looking at for the specified data and outputs it into a file.

One use case of this design could be to scrape the data out of an online database platform into a txt file in order to pass that into a proprietary MySQL database.  

Now file just outputs it to a text file and displays it to the user along with an example of a popup pane.  

Real purpose of this file is so I can teach people how to design simple screen scraping chrome extensionsusing unattached php files
